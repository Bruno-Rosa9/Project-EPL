# Pythagorean Expectation in the Premier League

This project focuses on applying Pythagorean Expectation, a concept originally used in baseball, to analyze the performance of Premier League clubs. The idea is to estimate how many points a team should have scored based on goals scored and conceded, comparing this with the actual score.

## What is Pythagorean Expectation?

The formula estimates a team's expected performance based on its goals scored (GF) and goals conceded (GA):

Expected Points = (Goals Scored) / ((Goals Scored) + (Goals Conceded))
